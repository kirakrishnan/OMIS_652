Motel Reservation
</h3>
<p>
My business plan is a motel. We have different types of rooms (Q, NQ, QQ, NQQ,
K, NK, ph).Customers can book rooms in three ways. They can either book it 
online through a third party site,call to the motel front desk and book a room
and they can also do walk in reservation.
</p>
<p>
We need to keep track of all the customer data. And we need to give discount
to customers who do the reservations regularly. We have branches at multiple
places. Each branch has different type of employees to perform different task.
</p>
<p>
Every day many people will be checking out of the rooms. The status of the room
is changed to dirty. After that housekeeping employees should go and clean it.
After the house keeping is done the status of the room is changed to clean so 
that it can be given to the customer who comes next.
